/**
 * The branch keys the catalogue bakes in, and the one thing that must be true of them: they
 * are the keys the gambit page would compute, not a second answer to the same question.
 *
 * The catalogue deliberately downloads no entry tree — that is why 1,003 entries cost 26.3KB
 * gzipped, keys included — so a card cannot walk one itself, and a card that showed a
 * different total from the page it links to would be worse than a card that showed none.
 * The guarantee is structural rather than asserted: the build calls `countableBranches`
 * from `src/components/progress/branches.ts`. These tests are what keeps that structure
 * from being quietly replaced by a copy.
 *
 * **Keys rather than a count** since issue #48. A count is enough for the denominator and
 * not for the numerator: a card holding only a total can clamp the marks it finds in storage
 * against it, where the page intersects them with the keys its tree has, and the two part
 * company the moment a mark outlives its branch. So what is pinned here is the list, in
 * order, and not merely its length.
